a) -0.25
You lost condition for Cost is null and mistyped the result for ELSE.
Correct answer:
SELECT Name,
		CASE WHEN StandardCost=0 OR StandardCost IS NULL THEN 'Not for sale'
			WHEN StandardCost>0 AND StandardCost<100 THEN '<$100'
			WHEN StandardCost >=100 AND StandardCost<500 THEN '<$500'
			ELSE '>$500'
		END AS PriceRange
FROM Production.Product

c) -1
You don't need a subquery to have a filter by aggregated function.
Correct answer:
SELECT p.Name, COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) as cnt
FROM Production.Product p JOIN sales.SpecialOfferProduct sp ON p.ProductID=sp.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Name
HAVING COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) >1
